# Speed_detection
Speed detection project using python

A speed detection project using Python involves analyzing video footage or images from a camera to detect and track moving objects, typically vehicles. The system calculates the speed of these objects by measuring distances traveled between frames and the time elapsed. Speed information can be displayed in real-time or logged for later analysis. Calibration, thresholding, optimization, testing, integration, and documentation are important aspects of the project. Key libraries used include OpenCV for computer vision and NumPy for numerical computations.
